# AI Agents Project

## Overview
The **AI Agents Project** is a modular and extensible system designed to explore emerging technologies related to AI Agents, with a particular focus on leveraging the **AutoGen Framework**. This project emphasizes experimentation, integration, and deployment of AI-driven solutions. It is built with flexibility and scalability in mind, providing an organized structure for handling configurations, secrets, and agent workflows.

The project leverages the **AutoGen Framework** to simplify the creation and management of AI agents, making it highly adaptable to a wide range of use cases.

This project is perfect for experimentation, integration, and deployment of AI-driven solutions. âœ¨ðŸ¤–ðŸš€
